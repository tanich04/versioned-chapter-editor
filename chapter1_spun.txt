Okay, here's a modern rewrite of Chapter 1 of "The Gates of Morning," aiming for a more engaging and contemporary feel while staying true to the original story:

## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder

Dick, perched on a coral outcrop, scanned the southern horizon. Behind him, the ocean roared, spitting spray into the wind. Ahead? A mirror-smooth expanse of blue – the Karolin lagoon. Fishing gulls wheeled and cried above its tranquil surface. Forty miles of coral reef encircled this giant pond, turning it into a self-contained sea – a tempest in high winds, a serene sapphire lake in calm weather.

And, as of yesterday, it was *his.*

Women, kids, young men, all bustling on the beach under the fierce tropical sun. Fishing with nets, playing games, tending their gardens – all his people now. Canoes lined the sand, sleek and ready. Empty houses stood silent, where war canoes once rested, waiting for battle.

But as Dick's gaze shifted from the shimmering lagoon to the empty canoe houses, a shadow crossed his face. He turned his back on the peaceful scene, facing the crashing waves and the open northern sea. Somewhere out there, invisible beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree Island. Beautiful, so beautiful it was like a dream, but a dream infested with nightmares.

Little Tari, son of Le Taioi, the net maker, sat nearby on the coral, watching him. Tari might not know much about life, but he knew Karolin was vulnerable. War had taken all the men, leaving the women, boys, and children defenseless, leaderless.

Then, *yesterday*, out of the northern sea, a strange boat appeared. In it was Katafa, the girl who'd been lost at sea years ago, and *him* – this new, strange figure. Sent by the gods, the women whispered, to be their chief, their protector.

The kid didn't care about the gods. He was alone with this fascinating stranger, and out of earshot of his mom, he decided to cut to the chase.

"Taori," Tari piped up, "who are you?" (é kamina tai)

Could Dick even *begin* to answer that question? Would Tari even understand? "Tari," he might have said, "I come from a world you wouldn't believe. My name *used* to be Dick Lestrange. When I was even smaller than you, I was stranded with an old sailor, Kearney, on that island you call Marua – Palm Tree. We lived there, fished, and Kearney made me toys – little ships, not like your canoes. Then, one day, Katafa arrived. She’d been blown away from Karolin in a storm. We lived together until Kearney died, and then it was just us. She taught me your language, and that's when they started calling me Taori. We loved each other, and might have stayed on Marua forever, but a ship came – a ship full of bad men from the islands of Melanesia. They came to cut the trees. Then they mutinied and killed the white men, burned the ship, and we barely escaped in our dinghy, taking everything we cared about with us, even the little ships. We followed the lagoon light in the sky, and that’s how we found Karolin."

But he *couldn't* tell Tari all of that. The name "Dick" was almost a ghost, a forgotten echo. The language he'd spoken as a child had faded, replaced by the tongue of Karolin. Kearney, the sailor who'd raised him, was slipping away, lost in the shimmering haze of his past. For men shipwrecked and alone, the past became blurred, indistinct. For Dick, his life really began with Katafa's arrival on Marua. Everything before that was consumed by the blazing sun, the crashing storms, the damp mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney might have been completely gone, if not for those little ships he'd made, the only souvenirs of a childhood he could barely remember.

He looked down at the curious child. "I am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?"

"I don't know," the kid shrugged. "I just ask. But no one big ever answers Tari's questions." He’s not wrong. "Ai, the fish!" His easily distracted mind latched onto something new - the shouts of kids hauling in a net. He was gone, trotting off down the beach.

Dick turned back to the north. The child's simple question had unlocked something in his mind. He saw the schooner again, burning on the beach of Palm Tree, the Melanesian sailors. He saw Katafa and himself, fleeing in the dinghy Kearney had taught him to handle. He saw their landing on this beach yesterday, the women and children crowding around, seeing him as a godsend, their new chief.

But as he stared north, the memory of the men they'd escaped stained the beauty of the sea and sky.

There was no immediate threat. The men on Palm Tree had no canoes. *Yet*. But they would build them. They *would* see the far-off blaze of the Karolin lagoon in the sky, just as he had. And they would come. It might be a while, but they would come.

Dick was nearly a native, a Kanaka, a savage, or so he thought. And yet, the white man was there, buried deep inside of him. He could think ahead, plan, strategize. He'd already sent a canoe to the southern beach to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – three old-timers, too old to fight, but master canoe builders. He'd seen the potential in the tribe: nearly a hundred young men ripening into warriors. But beneath it all, driving him, was his fierce love for Katafa, his other half, more precious than his own life. She was the one they threatened.

War canoes. Did he intend to defend the lagoon, to fight them on the beach? Or did he have a more audacious plan? A preemptive strike? To destroy the threat before it could take shape? Only time would tell.

A hand touched his shoulder. He turned to face Katafa. A strand of her dark hair had escaped the vine holding it back, fluttering in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her eyes, dark and luminous, were fixed on the same point he’d been staring at – the northern sea line.

"Look," she said, her voice low.

At certain times, under certain conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, appeared in a mirage. Last evening, they'd seen it. Now, it was happening again. A mysterious stain, a dark smudge, low in the northern sky. It grew, sharpened, as if an unseen artist were sketching it into existence. The island rose from the sea, beautiful as a dream, both transparent and vivid.

With her hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds untainted by science or understanding of mirages. They only knew that they were staring at the place they had escaped, rising now as if to haunt them.

They saw again the horde of savages on the beach, monstrous figures from a nightmare. They felt the wind filling the sail, driving their dinghy towards safety, towards the open sea. They heard the drunken yells of the Melanesians, fueled by rum stolen from the schooner they had burned. And there, before them, was the scene of the tragedy, a picture-postcard-perfect view that hid the demons who still inhabited it.

As Dick gazed at the beauty that was also a threat, his nostrils flared. His eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him, and now, they were threatening Katafa.

They *would* come. He felt it in his bones. The vision of Palm Tree confirmed what instinct already told him. They would build canoes. They would see the lagoon light in the sky. They had no women, those men. And here were women. Like him being drawn to Katafa, these men would be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon, searching for an island to raid. And seeing the lagoon light, they would come.

But danger wasn't just to the north. It lurked wherever greed, desire, or hatred could roam. Not just among savages, but also the wolves of civilization.

To Dick, there was no world beyond the waters surrounding the two islands. No Europe, no America, no history except the history of his short life, and the life of Katafa. And yet, even in that short life, he'd learned to fear men. He'd glimpsed the foundation of all history: man's instinct for war, for plunder, for destruction.

Gradually, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing like a snuffed-out candle. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.

It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. They left the coral outcrop and walked down to the white sand to meet them.
